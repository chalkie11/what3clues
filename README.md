# What3Clues

This is a flask based web game.

You will need to sign up for a What3Words API account from `https://accounts.what3words.com/create-api-key?referrer=/public-api` then replace the text in `YOUR_KEY.txt` with your API key. 

To play, run `python what3clues` then navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your browser.

Use the clues to identify the location of the What3Words pin, then enter the text into the answer box.
